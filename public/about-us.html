    <h2>The Basics </h2> 
     <ul>
        <li>
        I have been working on web sites for years now and still enjoy the 
        never ending creativity and often times, problem solving.  I also enjoy
        the act of listening to a client define what they would like to have for 
        their site, and then making that come to life with programming.  It's an
        art form to me and a very enjoyable one.</li>
